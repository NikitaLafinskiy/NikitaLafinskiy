Hello, I am @NikitaLafinskiy
I have been coding for 3 years, throughout this time I have been built many websites (both frontend and backend sides)
that utilize such technollogies as React/Redux, Node/Express, SQL/Mongo and much more!
For the last half a year I have been thoroughly studying Machine Learning technologies such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib and scikit-learn. 
I am currently learning tensorflow to start working on more complicated models such as CV, NLP and TimeSeries predictions.
You can reach me via my email --> @niklafinskiy@gmail.com
